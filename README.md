# Enhancing Disease Prediction Accuracy

In this project, we aim to enhance the accuracy of disease prediction based on given symptoms using machine learning techniques. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we seek to provide a robust and reliable tool for early diagnosis and improved healthcare outcomes. The project involves the implementation and evaluation of four main machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes. Each algorithm is applied to a dataset of symptoms and corresponding diseases to predict the likelihood of specific diseases. Through comprehensive comparison and contrast, we analyze the performance, accuracy, and computational efficiency of these algorithms to determine the most effective approach for disease prediction. The insights gained from this project have the potential to significantly advance the field of medical diagnostics and personalized medicine.
